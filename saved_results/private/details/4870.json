Words like \"most thrilling\" express a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. A database can tell us facts like lap times, positions, retirements, etc., but it cannot tell us whether a race was \"thrilling\" or not.\n\nEven if the database contains information about the 2008 Australian Grand Prix, there is no objective measure of \"thrilling\" that can be derived from race data. This is a subjective opinion.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the 2008 Australian Grand Prix was 'the most thrilling' season opener \u2014 this is a subjective value judgment.
