Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says: **\"If a late safety car period had occurred in the 2006 United States Grand Prix, the top 10 drivers' fastest laps would have averaged faster due to reduced fuel loads.\"**\n\nKey indicators:\n- **\"If a late safety car period had occurred\"** \u2014 this describes a hypothetical event that didn't happen\n- **\"would have averaged faster\"** \u2014 speculative outcome based on the hypothetical\n- **\"due to reduced fuel loads\"** \u2014 causal reasoning about a hypothetical scenario\n\nThis is a classic **counterfactual** claim. It asks what *would have happened* under different circumstances (a safety car period), not what actually happened. The database only records what actually occurred during races \u2014 it cannot tell us what would have happened in an alternate scenario.\n\nPer the workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
