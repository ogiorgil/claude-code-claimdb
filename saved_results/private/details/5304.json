The database only records what actually happened, not what would have occurred under different weather conditions.

It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the Canadian Grand Prix had been run entirely under full-wet conditions...\" This is an imagined \"what if\" scenario that never actually happened (or at least, the database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different weather conditions).\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nNo database query is needed here. The claim's core assertion depends on a hypothetical condition (\"if the race had been run entirely under full-wet conditions\") that cannot be verified from historical data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
