The claim makes two value assertions:\n1. That omitting full names is \"artistically appropriate\"\n2. That it \"enhances their mystique\"\n\nEven though the database may contain information about which superheroes have NULL full names (and the hint confirms this), the core assertion of the claim is not about the *count* of heroes without full names \u2014 it's about whether that omission is \"artistically appropriate\" and \"enhances mystique.\" These are aesthetic and subjective judgments that cannot be verified from data in a database.\n\nNo SQL query can determine whether missing data is \"artistically appropriate\" or \"enhances mystique.\" The database records factual attributes of superheroes, not aesthetic evaluations of data completeness.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim makes subjective value judgments ('artistically appropriate', 'enhances their mystique') about the omission of full names.
