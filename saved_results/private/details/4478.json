It describes a hypothetical scenario (\"If a safety car had been deployed...\") and speculates about what would have happened (\"several retirements would likely have been avoided\"). The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different circumstances.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If...had been deployed\" and \"would likely have been avoided\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database only contains records of what actually occurred during races, not simulations of alternative scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
