Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** Formula 1 **considered** any driver who completed at least 90% of the scheduled race distance to be a finisher...\" \u2014 this is a hypothetical rule change scenario. It asks what **would** happen under an alternative definition of \"finisher.\"\n\nThe key language indicators:\n- \"If Formula 1 considered...\" \u2014 hypothetical condition\n- \"would be substantially lower\" \u2014 speculative outcome under the hypothetical\n\nThis is a classic counterfactual claim. The database records what actually happened (actual race results), not what would have happened under alternative rules or definitions. Even though one could potentially query the data to explore this scenario, the claim is fundamentally about a hypothetical \"what if\" situation.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"substantially lower\" is a subjective judgment \u2014 even if we could compute numbers, whether the difference qualifies as \"substantial\" is a value judgment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone.\n\nPer the instructions:\n- Counterfactual claims (\"If X had happened...\") must ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO\n- Subjective assessments (\"substantially lower\") also qualify as NOT ENOUGH INFO\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If Formula 1 considered...would be substantially lower') describing a hypothetical scenario under an alternative definition of 'finisher.'
