The word \"favorite\" is a subjective judgment \u2014 it refers to a personal preference that cannot be objectively determined from race data alone.\n\nEven if we could find data showing Schumacher won the most races or scored the most points at Sepang, that wouldn't tell us it was his \"favorite\" venue. A driver's favorite circuit is a matter of personal opinion, not something recorded in a results database.\n\nThis is a **subjective** claim. The database can tell us about race results, but not about a driver's personal preferences or feelings about a circuit.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that the Sepang International Circuit was Michael Schumacher's 'favorite' venue, which is a subjective personal preference.
