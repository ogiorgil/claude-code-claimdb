They must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThere is no need to query the database, as no amount of historical data can tell us what *would have* happened under a hypothetical scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim describing a hypothetical scenario ('If a safety car had been deployed...
