However, the claim says it has \"the highest all-time number of matches, totaling 3,040.\" Since it does have 3,040 matches and that is indeed tied for the maximum, this is a matter of whether having the highest count requires uniqueness.\n\nFollowing the hint: \"league with highest matches of all time refers to MAX(COUNT(league_id))\" \u2014 this query would return 3,040, and England Premier League is one of the leagues with that count. The claim says the EPL has the highest number at 3,040, which is factually accurate (it does have the max count). The claim doesn't say it's the *only* league with that count.
