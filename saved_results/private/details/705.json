It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank **had** extended Saturday opening hours...\" and speculates about what **would have** happened (\"the number of new accounts... **would have been** significantly higher\").\n\nThe claim uses classic counterfactual language:\n- \"If the bank had extended...\" (hypothetical past condition)\n- \"would have been significantly higher\" (speculated outcome)\n\nA database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different hypothetical conditions. There is no way to verify from historical data whether extending Saturday hours would have increased new accounts.\n\nPer the workflow rules, counterfactual claims should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, and I should never try to compute an answer for them.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim that speculates about what would have happened if the bank had changed its Saturday opening hours.
