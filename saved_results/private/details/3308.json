Whether contributions are \"insightful\" or not is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from database data alone.\n\nEven if the database contains information about the user 'probabilityislogic' (such as vote counts, scores, reputation, etc.), none of that data can tell us whether their contributions are \"exceptionally insightful.\" That's a matter of opinion and interpretation.\n\nPer my classification rules:\n\n> **SUBJECTIVE**: The claim expresses opinions, value judgments, or qualitative assessments that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Watch for words like: \"alarmingly\", \"impressively\", \"implausibly\", \"unremarkable\", \"eye-catching\", \"convenient\", \"nurturing\", \"overrepresentation\", \"suggests poor quality\", \"greatest of all time\". Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\n\n\"Exceptionally insightful\" is clearly a subjective judgment. Even if the hints suggest mapping this to bounty amounts or vote types, the core assertion remains a value judgment that cannot be verified from data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion that the user's contributions are 'exceptionally insightful' is a subjective value judgment.
