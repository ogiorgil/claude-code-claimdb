It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If [someone] had [done something], then [result] would be [different].\" The claim is asking what *would have happened* if an additional card had been commissioned \u2014 this is not something that actually occurred.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If...had commissioned...\" and \"would be higher by one\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language.\n\nEven though the mathematical tautology (adding one to any count increases it by one) seems trivially true, the database only records what actually happened, not hypothetical scenarios. I should not attempt to compute or verify counterfactual claims.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If...had commissioned...would be higher by one' language, describing a hypothetical scenario about what would have happened if an additional card were created.
