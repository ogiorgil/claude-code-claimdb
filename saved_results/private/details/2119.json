It says \"If Magic: The Gathering rules **had required** that all cards with original type 'Summon - Angel' carry the 'Angel' subtype from their first printing, there **would be** no cards with original type 'Summon - Angel' and a non-'Angel' subtype.\"\n\nThis uses classic counterfactual language:\n- \"If [rules] **had required**...\" (hypothetical past condition)\n- \"there **would be** no cards...\" (hypothetical consequence)\n\nThe claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario about what would have happened if the rules had been different. According to my classification guidelines:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe database records what actually happened with card types and subtypes, not what would have happened under different rules. Even though one could query the database for cards with original type \"Summon - Angel\" and check their subtypes, the claim's core assertion is about a hypothetical rule change and its consequences \u2014 this is inherently counterfactual.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
