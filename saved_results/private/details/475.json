It asks about the 'budget impact' of a policy that hasn't been enacted, which cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. Even if we could count virtual schools by county, the budget impact of opening physical drop-in centers depends on factors (construction costs, staffing, location, etc.) not present in the database.

It describes a scenario that hasn't happened (\"If California required...\") and makes assertions about what \"would\" happen under that hypothetical policy (\"would experience a larger budget impact\"). \n\nKey indicators:\n- \"If California required...\" \u2014 hypothetical condition\n- \"would experience\" \u2014 speculative outcome\n- \"budget impact\" \u2014 the database is about schools, not budgets; there's no way to determine the cost of opening drop-in centers\n- \"in 2026\" \u2014 future scenario\n\nEven though we could count virtual schools per county, the claim is about **budget impact**, which is a concept that cannot be derived from a schools database. The number of virtual schools alone doesn't determine budget impact \u2014 that would depend on construction costs, staffing, location, etc.\n\nMoreover, this is fundamentally a counterfactual claim about what **would happen** under a hypothetical policy change. Per the instructions, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim describing a hypothetical scenario ('If California required...would experience...').
