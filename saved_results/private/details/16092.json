There's no information in a student club database about bulk discount pricing, discount thresholds, or what prices would have been under different ordering scenarios.\n\nThis is clearly a **counterfactual** claim \u2014 it uses \"If... had combined... would have lowered...\" language, describing an imagined scenario that cannot be verified from historical data.\n\nPer the instructions, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
