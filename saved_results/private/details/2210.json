Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** Wizards of the Coast **rewrote** the sentence... the frequency of judge calls about those interactions at local events **would decrease**.\"\n\nThis is clearly a counterfactual claim:\n- It describes a hypothetical action (\"If Wizards of the Coast rewrote...\")\n- It predicts a hypothetical outcome (\"the frequency of judge calls... would decrease\")\n- It uses counterfactual language (\"If... would\")\n\nA database of card games records what actually exists on cards \u2014 it cannot tell us what **would happen** if text were rewritten, nor can it contain data about \"judge calls at local events\" or whether their frequency would change under hypothetical scenarios.\n\nPer my instructions: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
