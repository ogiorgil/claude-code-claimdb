It asks what **would** happen **if** a hypothetical action were taken (\"eliminated all local parcel tax revenues in 2026\"). The database records actual data, not hypothetical scenarios about future policy changes.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If... eliminated...\" and \"would drop\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language describing a hypothetical scenario about future policy changes and their effects.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
