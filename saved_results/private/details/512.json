Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** the K-8 magnet school in Adelanto with Multiple Provision Types **were to** discontinue its magnet designation, its enrollment **would drop** by at least 20% over the next two years.\"\n\nThis is clearly a counterfactual claim \u2014 it describes a hypothetical scenario (\"if X were to happen\") and predicts a future outcome (\"enrollment would drop\"). The database only records what actually happened, not what would happen under hypothetical changes.\n\nPer my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
