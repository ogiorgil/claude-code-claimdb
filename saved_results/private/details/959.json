Praha' during the period covered by the data, the number of male clients would have been higher.\"\n\nThis is a **counterfactual** claim. It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank **had** waived monthly account fees...\" and then speculates about what **would have** happened (\"the number of male clients would have been higher\").\n\nKey indicators of counterfactual language:\n- \"If the bank **had** waived...\" (past subjunctive / hypothetical condition)\n- \"...would have been higher\" (hypothetical consequence)\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios and CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. These must ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe database records actual historical data \u2014 it cannot tell us what would have happened under a different fee policy. Even if I could verify the current number of male clients in Praha, I cannot determine whether waiving fees would have increased that number.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
