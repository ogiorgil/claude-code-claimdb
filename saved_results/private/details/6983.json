Whether something is \"clinically surprising\" is a matter of medical opinion and interpretation \u2014 it cannot be verified from data in a database.\n\nEven though the database might contain data about triglyceride levels (TG) and symptoms, and we could count how many patients have TG < 200 with non-null symptoms, the claim's core assertion is about whether that pattern is \"clinically surprising\" \u2014 which is a subjective judgment that no amount of data can confirm or deny.\n\nPer the classification rules for SUBJECTIVE claims: \"Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that it is 'clinically surprising' when patients have normal triglyceride levels yet present with symptoms.
