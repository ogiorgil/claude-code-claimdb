It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If the Jesenik branch **had offered**...\" and speculates about what **would have** happened (\"more women **would have** opened accounts\"). This is a \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened.\n\nPer the workflow rules, counterfactual claims should always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, and I should never try to compute an answer for them.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
