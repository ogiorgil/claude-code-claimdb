The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical voting limit enforcement.\n\nPer my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If daily voting limits had been enforced...\" which is a counterfactual conditional. The database only records actual votes and scores \u2014 it cannot tell us what scores posts would have received under a different voting policy.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim is counterfactual \u2014 it asks what would have happened 'if daily voting limits had been enforced,' which is a hypothetical scenario.
