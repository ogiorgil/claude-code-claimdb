A database can tell us *what* cards exist in a set and their properties, but it cannot tell us whether the selection is \"well-curated\" or creates a \"balanced play experience.\" Those are subjective assessments about game design quality.\n\nEven if I could query the database and find all three-mana cards in that set, no amount of data about card attributes (power, toughness, types, etc.) would allow me to objectively determine whether they are \"exceptionally well-curated\" or create a \"perfectly balanced play experience.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertions \u2014 that the cards are 'exceptionally well-curated' and create a 'perfectly balanced play experience' \u2014 are subjective value judgments about game design quality.
