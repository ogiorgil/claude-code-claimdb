Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim states: \"If video assistant referee (VAR) technology had been in use during the 2009/2010 Scotland Premier League season, at least two of Celtic's away victories would have been overturned.\"\n\nThis is a **counterfactual** claim. It describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario \u2014 \"If VAR technology had been in use...\" \u2014 and speculates about what would have happened under those conditions. The database records actual match results, not what would have happened if different refereeing technology had been used. There is no way to determine from match data alone whether any goals or results would have been overturned by VAR.\n\nThis falls squarely into the COUNTERFACTUAL category of NOT ENOUGH INFO, as the database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes to refereeing technology.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If VAR technology had been in use...') that speculates about hypothetical outcomes under different conditions.
