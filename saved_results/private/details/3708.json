Let me verify this assessment.\n\nThe word \"disappointingly\" is a subjective qualifier. Even if I can compute the exact proportion of users with 0 up votes among commenters whose comment scores fall between 5 and 10, whether that proportion is \"disappointing\" is a value judgment that cannot be verified from data alone.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO claims. The core assertion is not about what the number is, but about whether it is \"disappointingly low\" \u2014 which is an opinion.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the proportion is 'disappointingly low,' which is a subjective value judgment.
