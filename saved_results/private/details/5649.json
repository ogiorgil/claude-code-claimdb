It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 what would have happened if a player had followed a training program that they didn't actually follow. Key indicators:\n\n- \"If... had followed\" \u2014 counterfactual conditional\n- \"would have increased\" \u2014 hypothetical outcome\n- \"specialized finishing training program\" \u2014 an intervention that doesn't exist in the database\n\nThe database records what actually happened (player attributes, match results, etc.), not what would have happened under hypothetical training interventions. No database query can verify whether a training program would have increased a player's finishing by 5 points.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
