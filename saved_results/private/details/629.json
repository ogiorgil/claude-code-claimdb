It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank had required in-person interviews...\" This is a \"what if\" scenario about something that did not actually happen. The database records what actually occurred, not what would have happened under different policies.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims should always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, regardless of what data might exist in the database. I should not attempt to compute an answer for this hypothetical scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
