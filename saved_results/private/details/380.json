It describes a \"what if\" scenario:\n- \"If the Elementary School District **were to** eliminate homework districtwide next year...\"\n- \"...would see no change in student attendance\"\n\nThis is speculating about what **would happen** under a hypothetical policy change (eliminating homework). A database records what actually happened, not what would happen if a district changed its homework policy. No database can verify whether eliminating homework would or wouldn't affect attendance.\n\nPer my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim uses exactly the counterfactual language pattern: \"If X were to [happen]... would [result].\" It asks about the effect of a hypothetical future policy change on attendance, which cannot be determined from historical data in a database.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
