It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If Wizards of the Coast had not updated the card frame in 2015...\" and then speculates about what would have happened (\"at least 100 additional John Avon designs would have had non-powerful foils\").\n\nAs per my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If... had not...\" and \"would have had...\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under a hypothetical scenario where Wizards of the Coast made different decisions about card frames.\n\nEven though the hint suggests mapping concepts to specific columns (artist for John Avon, cardKingdomId/cardKingdomFoilId for foils), the core assertion is about a hypothetical alternate reality. No SQL query can verify what \"would have\" happened if a company had made different decisions.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If... had not...' and 'would have had...' language, describing a hypothetical scenario where Wizards of the Coast made different decisions about card frames in 2015.
