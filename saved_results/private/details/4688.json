It asks about a hypothetical scenario: \"If the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix had gone ahead as scheduled...\" The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled due to civil unrest, so this claim is asking what *would have happened* under different circumstances.\n\nThe claim uses the language \"If X had happened... Y would have been...\" which is classic counterfactual reasoning. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened if a cancelled race had taken place.\n\nEven with the hints suggesting how to compute the percentage, the core assertion is about a hypothetical scenario \u2014 we cannot know from the database what Lewis Hamilton's position would have been in a race that never occurred. The database records actual results, not hypothetical ones.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
