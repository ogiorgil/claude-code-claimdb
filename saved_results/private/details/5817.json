It uses:\n- \"If [hypothetical event] had [happened]...\"\n- \"...would have been [hypothetical consequence]\"\n\nThe database records what actually happened \u2014 actual match dates and results. It cannot tell us what **would have happened** under a hypothetical weather scenario (heavy snowfall). Whether matches would have been postponed, and to when, depends on league rules, logistics, and decisions that are not captured in a database of match results.\n\nPer the workflow rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If heavy snowfall had struck... matches would have been postponed').
