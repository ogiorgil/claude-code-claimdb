Even though the hint suggests mapping this to tallest superhero (MAX(height_cm)), whether being the tallest makes someone \"the most intimidating\" is a value judgment that a database cannot confirm or deny.\n\nThis falls under the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO. The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment (\"most intimidating\"), and even if we can verify height data, we cannot verify whether that makes someone \"intimidating.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim that Surtur is 'the most intimidating' superhero is a subjective value judgment.
