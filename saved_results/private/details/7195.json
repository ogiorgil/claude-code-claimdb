Whether an advertisement is \"compelling\" is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from numerical data alone.\n\nEven though the hint suggests comparing budget amounts (a ratio of advertisement spending), knowing that one event spent more on advertising than another does not tell us whether the advertisement was \"more compelling.\" Compelling is a subjective quality related to persuasiveness, appeal, and effectiveness \u2014 not just spending amount.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO: the claim expresses a value judgment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone, even if underlying numbers can be queried.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that one advertisement was 'more compelling' than another, which is a subjective value judgment about the quality/persuasiveness of advertisements.
