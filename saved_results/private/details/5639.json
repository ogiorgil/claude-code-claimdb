Even though the hint maps this to average home team goals (a numeric metric), whether a season is \"the most exciting\" is a value judgment. The database can tell us goal statistics, but it cannot tell us:\n- What supporters and journalists thought\n- Whether a season was \"exciting\"\n- Whether it was regarded as \"the most exciting\"\n\n\"Exciting\" is inherently subjective \u2014 high-scoring games might be exciting to some but not others. The claim's core assertion is about public perception and subjective quality assessment, which cannot be verified from match statistics alone.\n\nPer the instructions: \"If a claim's core assertion is a subjective judgment (even if it also contains verifiable numbers), classify as NOT ENOUGH INFO. Hints that map subjective language to numeric queries do NOT make a subjective claim verifiable.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective judgment \u2014 that supporters and journalists 'regarded' a season as 'the most exciting.'
