The database records actual data, not what would have occurred under different conditions. Counterfactual claims cannot be verified from a database.",

Even if the database contains information about fuel promotions, loyalty discounts, and customer consumption, it cannot tell us what would have happened in an alternate reality where those promotions didn't exist.\n\nKey indicators of a counterfactual claim:\n- \"If no fuel promotions or loyalty discounts **had been** offered\" (past subjunctive/conditional)\n- \"**would have been** lower\" (conditional outcome)\n\nPer the classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios must ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because databases only record what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If no fuel promotions or loyalty discounts had been offered... would have been lower.'
