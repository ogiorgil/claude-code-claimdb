A factual component: There is a numerical imbalance between male and female superheroes.\n2. A subjective/value judgment: This imbalance \"harms storytelling quality by limiting diverse perspectives.\"\n\nThe second part is a subjective assessment \u2014 whether a numerical imbalance \"harms storytelling quality\" and \"limits diverse perspectives\" is a value judgment that cannot be verified from data in a database. A database can tell us counts of male vs. female superheroes, but it cannot tell us whether that ratio harms storytelling quality.\n\nEven though I could verify whether there's a numerical imbalance, the **core assertion** of the claim is that this imbalance *harms storytelling quality*. That is inherently subjective and cannot be determined from database records.\n\nPer the classification rules:\n- **SUBJECTIVE**: The claim expresses a value judgment (\"harms storytelling quality by limiting diverse perspectives\") that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Even if the numerical imbalance can be confirmed, whether it \"harms storytelling quality\" is not something a database can verify.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The core assertion of the claim is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that a numerical imbalance between male and female superheroes 'harms storytelling quality by limiting diverse perspectives.'
