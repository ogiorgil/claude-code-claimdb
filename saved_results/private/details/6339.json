It uses \"If the hospital had applied...\" and \"would have been recorded...\" \u2014 classic counterfactual/hypothetical language. It's asking what would have happened under a different set of diagnostic criteria than what was actually used.\n\nThe database records what actually happened \u2014 actual diagnoses that were recorded. It does not contain information about:\n1. What diagnostic criteria were actually applied\n2. What the 2006 revised antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria are\n3. How applying different criteria would have changed diagnosis counts\n\nThis is a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
