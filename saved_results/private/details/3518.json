Even if I can compute the percentage, whether that percentage is \"disappointing\" or not is a subjective assessment.\n\nLet me verify this is indeed a subjective claim by checking the key language:\n\n- \"disappointingly low\" \u2014 subjective value judgment\n- \"for a healthy knowledge-sharing community\" \u2014 subjective standard/benchmark\n\nEven though the hint provides a way to compute the percentage, the core assertion of the claim is that this percentage is \"disappointingly low,\" which is a qualitative judgment that cannot be verified from database data alone.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the share of 2011 posts by high-reputation owners was 'disappointingly low for a healthy knowledge-sharing community.'
