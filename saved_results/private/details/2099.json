It describes an imaginary rule (\"If official Magic rules required all toughness values to be prime numbers...\") and then reasons about what would happen under that hypothetical constraint.\n\nWhile it's mathematically true that 99 is not a prime number (99 = 9 \u00d7 11), the claim is about a hypothetical rule change that doesn't exist. The database records actual card data as it is, not what would happen under imagined alternative rules. This is a textbook counterfactual claim.\n\nPer the classification guidelines, counterfactual claims \u2014 those describing \"what if\" scenarios \u2014 **CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened** and must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
