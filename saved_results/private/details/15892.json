Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says \"**If** the club switched to unisex t-shirt sizing next semester, the number of Business majors choosing size M **would increase**.\"\n\nThis is a classic counterfactual claim:\n- It describes a hypothetical scenario (\"If the club switched to unisex t-shirt sizing\")\n- It predicts what **would** happen under that scenario (\"the number... would increase\")\n- The database only records what actually happened, not what would happen under a hypothetical change to sizing systems\n\nThe database cannot tell us what students would choose if a different sizing system were offered. This requires speculation about future behavior under changed conditions, which no historical database can verify.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
