It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If characters commonly regarded as anti-heroes were reclassified...\" This is asking about what **would happen** under an imagined reclassification. \n\nKey issues:\n1. The claim uses \"If...were reclassified\" \u2014 classic counterfactual/hypothetical language.\n2. The concept of \"characters commonly regarded as anti-heroes\" is subjective and not something that can be determined from database fields alone. The database likely has alignment values (Good/Bad/Neutral), but \"commonly regarded as anti-heroes\" is an external, subjective classification.\n3. Even if we could identify anti-heroes, the database records what **is**, not what **would be** under hypothetical reclassifications.\n\nPer the instructions:\n- **COUNTERFACTUAL**: \"The claim describes a hypothetical 'what if' scenario. Look for language like 'If X had happened...', 'Had X been done...', 'If X were changed...', 'Would have...' These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\"\n\nThis claim clearly fits the counterfactual pattern with \"If characters... were reclassified... would drop below 50%.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"commonly regarded as anti-heroes\" is a subjective assessment \u2014 the database has no field indicating which characters are \"commonly regarded as anti-heroes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If characters... were reclassified... would drop below 50%') describing a hypothetical scenario.
