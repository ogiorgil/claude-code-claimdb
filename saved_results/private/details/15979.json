Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** the Yearly Kickoff **had** gone over budget, the treasurer **would have** reassigned budget oversight to a different student.\"\n\nThis is classic counterfactual language:\n- \"If X had happened...\" (hypothetical condition)\n- \"...would have...\" (hypothetical consequence)\n\nThe claim describes a hypothetical scenario about what **would have happened** under imagined circumstances. A database only records what **actually happened**, not what would have happened under different conditions. There's no way to verify or refute this from the data.\n\nPer the rules: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If...had...would have...' language, describing a hypothetical scenario about what would have happened if the Yearly Kickoff had gone over budget.
