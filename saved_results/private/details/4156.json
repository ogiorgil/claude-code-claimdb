A database can tell us numeric speed attribute values, but it cannot tell us what fans consider or whether something is \"exhilarating.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim is subjective \u2014 it asserts what 'most fans consider' and describes speed depictions as 'more exhilarating,' which are opinion-based value judgments that cannot be verified from database records of speed attribute values.
