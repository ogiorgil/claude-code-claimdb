It describes a scenario that hasn't happened (\"If the bank introduced...\") and speculates about what **would** happen as a result. The database records actual data, not hypothetical future scenarios involving policy changes.\n\nKey counterfactual indicators:\n- \"If the bank introduced...\" \u2014 hypothetical condition\n- \"...would exceed 55%\" \u2014 speculative outcome\n\nThe database can tell us the **current** proportion of female customers at the Prague branch, but it cannot tell us what would happen if a new fee waiver policy were introduced in 2026. That would depend on behavioral responses, market dynamics, and other factors not captured in the database.\n\nPer my instructions: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
