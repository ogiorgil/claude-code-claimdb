It begins with \"If bank loan interest rates... had been uniformly two percentage points higher\" \u2014 describing a hypothetical scenario that didn't actually happen. The database records what actually occurred, not what would have happened under different interest rate conditions.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If... had been...\" language describing a hypothetical change to interest rates and asks what the outcome would have been. This is a textbook counterfactual.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
