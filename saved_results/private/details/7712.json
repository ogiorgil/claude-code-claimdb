A factual component: the share of customers using EUR on 2012-08-25\n2. A subjective judgment: that this share was \"disappointingly low from a risk-management perspective\"\n\nThe phrase \"disappointingly low from a risk-management perspective\" is a subjective value judgment. Whether a particular share is \"disappointing\" or concerning from a risk-management standpoint is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Even if I can compute the exact share, the database cannot tell us whether that number is \"disappointing\" or what constitutes an appropriate level from a risk-management perspective.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that the share of EUR customers was 'disappointingly low from a risk-management perspective.'
