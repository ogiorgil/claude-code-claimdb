Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If X had been... there would be...' language.
