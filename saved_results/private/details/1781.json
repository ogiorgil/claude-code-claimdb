This is a speculative claim about a scenario that hasn't occurred, and no amount of querying the current database can verify or refute it.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual/hypothetical claim about what would happen if the database were expanded in the future.
