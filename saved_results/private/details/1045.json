It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank had **not** run a women-focused marketing campaign...\" and then speculates about what **would have** happened (\"the share of women... would have been substantially lower\").\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim uses exactly this pattern:\n- \"If the bank had not run...\" (hypothetical condition)\n- \"would have been substantially lower\" (speculated outcome)\n\nThe database records what actually happened \u2014 it cannot tell us what would have happened in an alternate reality where a marketing campaign didn't exist. Even if the database contains information about districts, salaries, genders, and accounts, it cannot verify a counterfactual about the effect of removing a marketing campaign.\n\nAdditionally, the claim references \"a women-focused marketing campaign\" \u2014 let me quickly verify whether such a concept even exists in the schema, though the counterfactual nature alone is sufficient for classification."
