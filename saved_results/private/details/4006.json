It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If team affiliation were used to filter the dataset...\" \u2014 it's asking what **would** happen under a hypothetical filtering condition. The phrase \"If X were used to...\" is classic counterfactual language.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim asks what would happen \"if\" a filtering operation were applied. It's describing a hypothetical scenario about changing how the dataset is queried. This is a counterfactual claim.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
