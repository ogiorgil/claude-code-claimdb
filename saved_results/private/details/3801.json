It asks what *would have happened* under an imagined editorial rule. The database records what actually exists, not what would have happened under hypothetical policies.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If Marvel Comics had enforced...\" and \"there would be no...\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. Even though one could query the database to find Marvel heroes with gold eyes, the claim is about what *would have happened* under a hypothetical editorial rule during a specific era (Bronze Age). The database doesn't contain information about when characters were created (Bronze Age timing), nor can it simulate the effects of hypothetical editorial policies.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If Marvel Comics had enforced...' and 'there would be no...' language.
