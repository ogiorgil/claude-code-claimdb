It asks \"what if\" tournament rules changed X to a fixed value of 2 for all spells \u2014 this is a hypothetical scenario that didn't actually happen. The database records actual card data, not hypothetical rule changes.\n\nKey indicators of counterfactual reasoning:\n- \"If tournament rules... fixed X at 2...\"\n- \"would not appear...\"\n\nPer my instructions: *\"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"*\n\nEven though one could theoretically try to compute mana costs with X=2, the claim is fundamentally about a hypothetical rule change scenario. The database only records what actually is, not what would happen under modified rules.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
