It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If the Australian Grand Prix had been postponed by one month\" \u2014 and asks what would have happened under that imagined condition. Key indicators:\n\n- \"If ... had been postponed\" \u2014 counterfactual conditional\n- \"would still have been\" \u2014 hypothetical outcome\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe database records what actually happened, not what would have happened if a race were postponed. Even though one might attempt to compute ages under a shifted date, the instruction is clear: counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If the Australian Grand Prix had been postponed by one month... would still have been').
