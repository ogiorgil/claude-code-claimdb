The key words are:\n- \"**arbitrary**\" - a subjective assessment about the choice of 180 cm as a cutoff\n- \"**potentially misleading**\" - a qualitative judgment about the benchmark's validity\n\nEven though the hint maps this to a numeric query (calculating the percentage of players under 180 cm with overall_rating > 70), the core assertion of the claim is not about any specific number. It's asserting that using 180 cm as a cutoff is \"arbitrary\" and \"potentially misleading\" \u2014 these are opinions/value judgments that cannot be verified or refuted by data alone.\n\nNo SQL query can tell us whether a benchmark is \"arbitrary\" or \"misleading.\" The database records player heights and ratings, but it cannot tell us whether a particular analytical choice is good or bad methodology.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that using 180 cm as a height cutoff is 'arbitrary' and 'potentially misleading.'
