It asks what **would have happened** under a hypothetical scenario \u2014 specifically, if DRS zones had been removed. The database records what actually happened in races, not what would have happened under different technical regulations.\n\nKey counterfactual indicators:\n- \"If the Austrian Grand Prix Circuit **had removed** all DRS zones...\"\n- \"the lap record **would have been**...\"\n\nThis is a classic \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from historical data. A database of Formula 1 results records actual lap times under actual conditions \u2014 it cannot tell us what lap times would have been without DRS.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
