It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If X had not happened... then Y would have happened.\" The claim is about what *would have* occurred under a different set of circumstances (not obtaining a licence before a certain date).\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If the youngest driver had not obtained...\" and \"would have been deferred\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical regulatory scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If...had not obtained..., would have been deferred' language.
