It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If Spain LIGA BBVA had reduced the number of participating teams...\" This is a \"what if\" scenario about something that didn't actually happen. The claim speculates about what would have happened under different conditions.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\" These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe key phrase is \"If Spain LIGA BBVA had reduced the number of participating teams\" \u2014 this is explicitly a counterfactual conditional. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened if a league changed its number of teams.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
