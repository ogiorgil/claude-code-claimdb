It uses the structure \"If X had been [hypothetical condition], Y would have been [hypothetical outcome].\" Specifically:\n- \"If the serum... **had been** markedly hemolyzed\" \u2014 describes a hypothetical condition that didn't actually occur\n- \"the measured total bilirubin **would have been** artificially altered\" \u2014 describes a hypothetical consequence\n\nThis is describing a \"what if\" scenario about what would happen to a lab measurement under hypothetical conditions (hemolysis). The database records actual measurements and actual conditions \u2014 it cannot tell us what **would have happened** under different circumstances.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim clearly falls into the counterfactual category with its \"If... had been... would have been...\" structure.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If the serum... had been markedly hemolyzed... would have been artificially altered.'
