            "thinking": "The claim mentions \"overall quality of play\" and \"fan sentiment.\" The database has Player_Attributes with `overall_rating` which could be interpreted as \"quality of play.\" However, there's no column about \"fan sentiment\" anywhere in the database. The overall_rating comes from FIFA video game ratings, not from fan sentiment about match quality.\n\nThe database doesn't contain any information about \"fan sentiment\" regarding match quality. There's no survey data, fan ratings, or any subjective quality assessment of matches.\n\nThis seems like a NOT ENOUGH INFO case - the database simply doesn't have data about fan sentiment or match quality ratings from fans.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. \n\nThe `overall_rating` in Player_Attributes is from FIFA games which are based on expert/community assessments. Could this be stretched to mean \"fan sentiment\"? That seems like a stretch. The claim specifically asks about fan sentiment regarding match quality, but the database only has FIFA game ratings for individual players, not fan opinions about how matches were played. This is clearly NOT ENOUGH INFO.",
