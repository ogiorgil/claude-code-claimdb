It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"if the hospital had adopted stricter diagnostic criteria\" \u2014 and speculates about what \"would have\" happened. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different diagnostic criteria.\n\nKey counterfactual language:\n- \"If the hospital had adopted...\"\n- \"...would have been lower\"\n\nEven though the hint maps this to a real SQL query about BEHCET diagnoses, the core assertion is about a hypothetical scenario that never occurred. The database cannot tell us what would have happened under different diagnostic criteria.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
