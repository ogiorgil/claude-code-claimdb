Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says \"**Had** the toxicology database **included** isotopic labeling information...\" \u2014 this is classic counterfactual/hypothetical language (\"Had X been done...\"). It describes a hypothetical scenario where the database contains isotopic labeling data, which it presumably does not.\n\nEven though there may be data about phosphorus and triple bonds in the database, the core assertion is about what **would** happen under a hypothetical change to the database (adding isotopic labeling information). The claim asserts that phosphorus in triple bonds \"would predominantly be the 31P isotope\" \u2014 this is a statement about a scenario that doesn't exist in the database.\n\nPer the instructions: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
