It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If regulatory criteria required concordant evidence from at least two independent assays...\" This is a \"what if\" scenario about changing the criteria for assigning carcinogenic labels. The database records what actually happened under the actual criteria, not what would happen under hypothetical alternative regulatory criteria.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThe claim uses \"If regulatory criteria required...\" and \"would be lower than...\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database contains the actual labels assigned under actual criteria, not what labels would be assigned under a different regulatory framework requiring concordant evidence from multiple assays.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
