The phrase \"least aesthetically pleasing\" is a subjective, qualitative judgment about the visual appeal of a player's heading technique. This is not something that can be objectively measured or verified from data.\n\nEven though the hint maps this to \"average heading accuracy\" (a numeric metric), whether a heading technique is \"aesthetically pleasing\" is a matter of opinion and subjective assessment. A player could have low heading accuracy but still have a visually pleasing technique, or vice versa. The core assertion is a value judgment that cannot be verified from database statistics alone.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim that Per Mertesacker had the 'least aesthetically pleasing heading technique' is a subjective value judgment about visual appeal.
