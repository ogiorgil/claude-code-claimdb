A database can tell us facts about cards (their language, power values, text, etc.), but it cannot tell us whether players perceive the wording as \"more elegant.\"\n\nThis is a classic case of a **subjective claim** - the claim makes a value judgment (\"more elegant wording\") that cannot be objectively verified from data alone, regardless of what numeric queries might be constructed.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that French-language cards without power are 'generally perceived by players to have more elegant wording' than English-language equivalents.
