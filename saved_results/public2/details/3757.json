A database of superheroes would contain factual data about heroes, their attributes, and powers, but it would not contain data about fan opinions or impressions of how \"impressive\" a superpower is.\n\nThis is a **SUBJECTIVE** claim. Even if we could query how many blue-eyed heroes have Agility vs. Flight, the claim isn't about counts \u2014 it's about whether fans find one power \"more impressive\" than another. That's a qualitative, opinion-based assertion that cannot be verified from a factual database.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that fans 'generally consider' Agility to be 'more impressive' than Flight among blue-eyed superheroes.
