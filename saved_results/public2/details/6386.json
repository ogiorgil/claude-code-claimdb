A database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes to a patient's diet.\n\nPer my classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, regardless of whether the underlying data exists. I should not attempt to compute or verify the hypothetical scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using hypothetical language ('If the patient had consumed...would have increased').
