The database records what powers heroes have, not how those powers would function in hypothetical vacuum conditions.\n\nHowever, let me also consider the hint: it maps \"can control wind\" to `power_name = 'Wind Control'`. Let me check if the claim might simply be about which of these heroes has Wind Control as a power.\n\nBut the claim goes beyond just checking who has Wind Control \u2014 it specifically introduces a hypothetical vacuum scenario and reasons about who could \"generate wind unaided\" in that environment. This involves physics reasoning about how powers work in a vacuum, which is not something a database can verify.\n\nThat said, let me re-read more carefully. The hint suggests the core verifiable question is: which of these three heroes has 'Wind Control'? Let me check that, but I'll still need to assess whether the counterfactual framing makes this NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim is fundamentally counterfactual: \"If X were stranded in a vacuum...\" \u2014 this is a hypothetical scenario. Per my instructions, counterfactual claims should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim describes a counterfactual/hypothetical scenario ('If Crystal, Red Tornado, and Tempest were stranded in a vacuum with no atmosphere...'), which involves reasoning about how superpowers would function under imagined conditions.
