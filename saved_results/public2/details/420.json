There is no way to verify or refute a counterfactual claim about the causal relationship between hypothetical funding increases and school openings using historical data alone.\n\nPer the classification rules, counterfactual claims must **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, and I should **never** try to compute an answer for them.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If California had increased per-pupil funding by 10% in 2002... would have opened').
