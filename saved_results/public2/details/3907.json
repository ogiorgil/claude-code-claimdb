Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** artists standardized character designs to reflect realistic human physiology for the shown heights, the average weight of female superheroes **would** rise by at least 10%.\"\n\nThis is a classic counterfactual claim:\n- It uses \"If... would...\" construction\n- It describes a hypothetical scenario (\"if artists standardized character designs to reflect realistic human physiology\")\n- It speculates about what **would** happen under imagined conditions\n- The database records the actual weights and heights of superheroes as they are, not what they would be under some hypothetical redesign based on \"realistic human physiology\"\n\nEven though we could query the database for the current average weight of female superheroes, and even though we could theoretically look up BMI charts for \"realistic\" weights at given heights, the core assertion is about a hypothetical change that never happened. The database only records what exists, not what would exist under alternative artistic choices.\n\nPer the workflow rules: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If... would...' language.
