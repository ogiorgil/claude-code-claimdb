It makes a value judgment about the *purpose* or *motivation* behind content warnings \u2014 asserting they are \"primarily a marketing tactic rather than a genuine safety measure.\" No database can store or verify the intent or motivation behind a design decision like adding a content warning. This is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively determined from data alone.\n\nEven though the database likely contains the columns `hasContentWarning`, `availability`, and `frameVersion` that could identify the relevant cards, the core assertion \u2014 that the warnings are \"marketing tactics\" rather than \"genuine safety measures\" \u2014 is a subjective judgment that no database query can verify.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment about the motivation behind content warnings ('primarily a marketing tactic rather than a genuine safety measure').
