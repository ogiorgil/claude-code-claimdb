It asks \"If no weather-related disruptions had occurred...\" \u2014 this is a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. The claim speculates about what *would have happened* under different conditions (no weather disruptions), which is not something that can be verified from a database that only records what actually happened.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If no weather-related disruptions had occurred...\" and \"would have finished\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language.\n\nEven if I could identify the Japanese constructors and their races with zero points, I cannot determine from the database whether weather disruptions actually affected those races, nor can I determine what would have happened absent those disruptions.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
