It describes a counterfactual situation about what *would* happen if atoms were changed.\n\nKey phrases:\n- \"If every sodium atom... were replaced by potassium\"\n- \"the number of molecules that **would** still be labeled\"\n\nThis is classic counterfactual language. The database records what molecules actually contain and their actual labels. It cannot tell us what would happen to labels if we changed the atomic composition of molecules. The labeling of molecules as carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic is based on real-world properties/experiments, not something that can be recomputed by swapping atoms in a database.\n\nPer the instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim is clearly counterfactual \u2014 it asks about a hypothetical chemical modification and its effect on labeling, which cannot be determined from the existing data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim is counterfactual \u2014 it describes a hypothetical scenario ('If every sodium atom were replaced by potassium') and asks what 'would' happen to the labels.
