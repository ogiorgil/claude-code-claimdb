Even if I can find the SAT participation numbers for the school(s) with the highest K-12 FRPM count, whether that level of participation is \"impressive\" is a matter of opinion \u2014 not something that can be objectively verified from data alone.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO. The claim's core assertion is a qualitative assessment (\"impressive\"), which cannot be determined from database records regardless of what the underlying numbers show.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim uses the subjective term 'impressive' to describe SAT participation levels.
