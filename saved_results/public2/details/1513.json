Whether replacing an atom with fluorine would preserve the same number of bonds depends on chemistry knowledge and molecular modeling, not on querying a database of existing molecular data.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
