It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If state facilities funding had been reduced by 10%...\" and then asserts what *would have* happened as a result (\"fewer elementary schools would have opened\").\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If... had been reduced...\" which is classic counterfactual language. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under a hypothetical funding reduction. No SQL query can verify or refute this causal/hypothetical assertion.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If state facilities funding had been reduced by 10%...' language.
