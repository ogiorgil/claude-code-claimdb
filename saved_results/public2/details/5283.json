This is a subjective/qualitative judgment about visual impressiveness that cannot be verified from database records of lap times and race results.

Whether a pole lap is \"visually impressive\" is a matter of opinion and aesthetic assessment, not something that can be determined from timing data in a database.\n\nEven though the hint maps this to a numeric query (MIN(q3) at Marina Bay in 2008), the claim's core assertion is about visual impressiveness, which is a subjective/qualitative judgment. The database can tell us lap times, but not whether a lap *looked* impressive.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n> SUBJECTIVE: The claim expresses opinions, value judgments, or qualitative assessments that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Watch for words like: \"alarmingly\", \"impressively\"... Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\n\nThis directly matches the guidance: \"Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that Felipe Massa's qualifying lap was 'the most visually impressive pole lap' of the 2008 season.
