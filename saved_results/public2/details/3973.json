No database of superhero data can objectively determine which power is more or less \"engaging to watch.\"\n\nEven though the hint suggests mapping to counts of powers, the core assertion is about subjective entertainment value (\"engaging to watch in live-action adaptations\"), which is a value judgment that cannot be verified from data alone.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim makes a subjective judgment about which power is more 'engaging to watch in live-action adaptations.'
