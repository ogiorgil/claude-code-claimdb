  "extra_info": "non-chartered schools refer to schools whose Charter = 0; K-12 means grades 1 through 12; percent of eligible free rate for K-12 = `Free Meal Count (K-12)` * 100 / `Enrollment (K-12)`",
  "predicted_label": "NOT ENOUGH INFO",
  "reasoning": "This is a counterfactual claim. It describes a hypothetical scenario ('If Los Angeles County adopted universal free school meals next year') and makes assertions about what would happen under that imagined policy change ('would not exceed 0.18%'). The database records actual data, not what would happen under hypothetical future policy changes. Counterfactual claims cannot be verified from a database and must be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.",

It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If Los Angeles County adopted universal free school meals next year...\" and then makes an assertion about what would happen under that hypothetical condition.\n\nThe claim uses classic counterfactual language:\n- \"If... adopted... next year\"\n- \"would not exceed\"\n\nThis is asking about a hypothetical future policy change and its consequences. The database only records what actually happened, not what would happen under imagined policy changes. According to my classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
