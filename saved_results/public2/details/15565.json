The claim is asserting that one achievement is \"more prestigious\" than another, which is an opinion/qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone.\n\nEven though the hint suggests computing a percentage of users who earned the \"Teacher\" badge, and even though we could compare that to the percentage of users with 1,000+ reputation points (rarity could be a proxy for prestige), the core assertion is about **prestige** \u2014 a subjective concept. Whether something is \"more prestigious\" is a value judgment that cannot be determined from database records alone.\n\nThe database can tell us:\n- How many users earned the \"Teacher\" badge\n- How many users have 1,000+ reputation points\n- The relative rarity of each\n\nBut it **cannot** tell us which is \"generally considered more prestigious.\" Prestige is a social/subjective concept not captured in the data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that earning the 'Teacher' badge is 'generally considered more prestigious' than gaining 1,000 reputation points.
