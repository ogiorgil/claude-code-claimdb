The phrase \"healthy and sustainable pace of growth\" is a value judgment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Even if I can compute the actual growth rate, whether that rate is \"healthy and sustainable\" is a matter of opinion and interpretation, not a factual assertion that can be checked against database records.\n\nA database can tell us *what* the growth rate is, but it cannot tell us whether that growth rate is \"healthy\" or \"sustainable\" \u2014 those are qualitative assessments that depend on context, industry benchmarks, economic conditions, and subjective interpretation.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the growth rate represents a 'healthy and sustainable pace of growth,' which is a subjective value judgment.
