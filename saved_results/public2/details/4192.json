Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** characters from animated television series **were added** to the dataset, the proportion of blue-eyed superheroes **would increase**.\"\n\nThis is a classic counterfactual claim \u2014 it describes a hypothetical scenario (\"if X were added\") and predicts what \"would\" happen. The database records what actually exists in the dataset, not what would happen if hypothetical new data were added from external sources.\n\nEven if I could query the current proportion of blue-eyed superheroes, I cannot verify:\n1. Which characters from animated television series are not already in the dataset\n2. What eye colors those hypothetical characters would have\n3. Whether adding them would increase the proportion of blue-eyed superheroes\n\nThe database contains no information about \"animated television series\" characters that are *not* in the dataset, so this hypothetical scenario cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If...were added...would increase' language.
