A database can store lap times, circuits, and countries, but it cannot tell us whether those times represent \"bravery\" or are \"impressive.\"\n\nEven if we could verify that Italian circuits have the fastest lap times or some other measurable metric, the claim's core assertion is about subjective qualities (\"impressive,\" \"bravery\") that are not data-verifiable.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that Italian lap records represent 'the most impressive display of driver bravery.'
