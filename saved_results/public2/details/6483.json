It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the definition of thrombocytopenia **had required**...\" \u2014 it's asking what **would have happened** under a different diagnostic criterion than the one actually used. The database records what actually happened, not what would have occurred under alternative medical definitions.\n\nKey counterfactual language:\n- \"If the definition **had required**...\"\n- \"...the proportion **would have been** lower\"\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. They must ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nEven though we could theoretically query platelet counts and SLE diagnoses, the claim is fundamentally asking about a hypothetical redefinition of a medical condition and its downstream effects on diagnosis proportions \u2014 this is a counterfactual scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
