It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If rain had started on lap 30...\" \u2014 and speculates about what would have happened under those imagined conditions. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different weather conditions.\n\nPer the classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If rain had started...\" and \"would not have achieved...\" \u2014 both hallmark counterfactual constructions.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If rain had started on lap 30... would not have achieved...').
