It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If all matches had been played at neutral venues\" \u2014 and then makes an assertion about what would have happened under that hypothetical condition. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened if matches were played at neutral venues.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim clearly starts with \"If all ... matches had been played at neutral venues\" \u2014 a classic counterfactual construction. The database has no data about what would happen at neutral venues; it only records actual match results.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If all matches had been played at neutral venues...'). The database only records actual match results, not hypothetical outcomes under different conditions. Counterfactual scenarios cannot be verified from historical data.\"}\n```"
