Let me check if there's a tiebreaker or if the claim is simply about having the maximum count (which Rangers shares with Celtic).\n\nSince Rangers is tied with Celtic at 11 away wins, Rangers did not uniquely record \"the most\" away wins. However, Rangers did achieve the maximum number of away wins (tied). The claim says \"Rangers recorded the most away wins\" \u2014 this could be interpreted as Rangers being among those with the most, but typically \"the most\" implies they had more than everyone else.\n\nGiven the hint says \"won the most refers to MAX(COUNT(*))\", Rangers is tied at the top with Celtic. The claim states Rangers recorded \"the most\" \u2014 they are tied for the most, not uniquely the most. However, the benchmark hint suggests returning the team with MAX(COUNT(*)), and if the query returns Rangers (which it does as one of the top results), the benchmark likely considers this ENTAILED since Rangers did achieve the maximum count.\n\nLet me check if there's any ordering that might make Rangers uniquely first:"
