It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank **had** eliminated monthly account maintenance fees...\" and then asserts what **would have** happened (\"the number of male clients there would have increased by at least 10%\").\n\nThe database records what actually happened \u2014 not what would have happened under hypothetical policy changes like eliminating fees. There is no way to verify from historical data whether eliminating fees would have caused a 10% increase in male clients.\n\nPer my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim uses \"If the bank had eliminated...\" and \"would have increased\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database cannot tell us what would happen under a hypothetical fee elimination policy.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If the bank had eliminated...' and 'would have increased by at least 10%'.
