It asks what **would have happened** if DRS had been banned. The database records what actually happened in Formula 1, not what would have happened under hypothetical rule changes like banning DRS. \n\nThe key counterfactual language is: \"If DRS had been banned...\" and \"would have been slower than...\" This describes a hypothetical scenario that cannot be verified from historical data.\n\nPer my classification rules:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
