A database can tell us about lap times, positions, incidents, etc., but it cannot tell us whether a race was \"entertaining.\"\n\nEven if the hints suggest ways to compute certain statistics (like time differences between drivers), the core assertion of the claim is about entertainment value, which is a qualitative, subjective assessment. No amount of numerical data can objectively determine which race was \"the most entertaining.\"\n\nThis falls squarely under the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO: the claim expresses a value judgment (\"most entertaining\") that cannot be objectively verified from data alone.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that the 2008 Australian Grand Prix was 'the most entertaining season opener of the decade.'
