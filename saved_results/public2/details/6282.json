It does not contain information about what would have occurred if the lab had been closed on weekends. Even if the database contains date information that could allow us to identify weekend tests, the counterfactual claim assumes that those patients simply wouldn't have been tested at all \u2014 but in reality, they might have been tested on other days instead. The database cannot tell us what would have happened in this hypothetical scenario.\n\nPer the classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If the laboratory had closed on weekends...').
