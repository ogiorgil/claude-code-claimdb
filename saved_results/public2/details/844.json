Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says: \"**If** law enforcement **had** doubled patrols... the number of accounts opened there... **would have been** lower.\"\n\nThis describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 what would have happened if a specific intervention (doubling patrols) had been implemented. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different policing strategies.\n\nKey indicators of a counterfactual:\n- \"If... had doubled patrols\" \u2014 hypothetical past action\n- \"would have been lower\" \u2014 speculated consequence\n\nEven though we could potentially identify which branch had the most crimes in 1996 and count accounts opened there in the second half of 1996, the core assertion is about a **hypothetical outcome** of an intervention that never occurred. The database cannot tell us whether increased police presence would have reduced account openings.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
