It says \"If a late-race safety car had been deployed...\" \u2014 this describes a hypothetical scenario that didn't actually happen. The claim is asking what *would have* happened under different circumstances.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim clearly uses \"If... had been deployed\" and \"would have\" language, making it a counterfactual scenario. The database only records what actually happened in races, not what would have happened if a safety car had been deployed at a different time.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If a late-race safety car had been deployed... no driver would have set a faster lap...').
