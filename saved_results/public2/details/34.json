Let me analyze it carefully.\n\nThe claim states: \"**If** all instruction at California schools that are exclusively virtual and have average SAT Math scores greater than 400 **were switched** to fully asynchronous delivery next year, their average SAT Math performance **would decline**.\"\n\nThis is clearly a counterfactual claim:\n- It uses \"If... were switched...\" (hypothetical conditional)\n- It speculates about what \"would\" happen in the future under a hypothetical change\n- It predicts a decline in performance based on a scenario that hasn't occurred\n\nThe database records actual historical data about schools. It cannot tell us what **would happen** to SAT Math scores if instruction delivery methods were changed to fully asynchronous. This is a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from recorded data.\n\nPer my classification rules: **Counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios ALWAYS get classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO**, because the database only records what actually happened, not what would happen under imagined changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
