It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the district had not secured a last-minute facilities bond...\" and then asserts what \"would have\" happened under that hypothetical condition. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different circumstances.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because databases only record what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nEven though I could potentially verify which K-12 school has the largest enrollment, the core assertion of this claim is about a counterfactual scenario involving a facilities bond and an alternative opening date \u2014 information that a database of school records cannot verify or refute.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
