It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If X had happened, then Y would have resulted.\" The key indicators are:\n\n- \"If the safety car **had been** deployed\" \u2014 subjunctive/conditional mood\n- \"would have been at least 3 km/h lower\" \u2014 speculating about a hypothetical outcome\n\nThe database records what actually happened in races. It cannot tell us what **would have happened** under different conditions (e.g., if a safety car had been deployed when it wasn't). Even if the database contains safety car data or fastest lap speeds, a counterfactual \"what if\" scenario cannot be verified from historical data.\n\nPer the instructions: *\"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"*\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
