  "reasoning": "While the database confirms there is a Netherlands Eredivisie match with a 10-goal home team (MAX(home_team_goal) = 10), the claim's core assertion is about a live television broadcast setting a national viewership record for a club football game. The database contains no information about television broadcasts, viewership figures, or viewership records \u2014 these concepts are entirely out-of-schema. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified or refuted.",

Netherlands Eredivisie (a league) - potentially in the database\n2. A match with a 10-goal home team - potentially verifiable\n3. **Live television broadcast** - likely not in a football database\n4. **National viewership record** - likely not in a football database\n\nLet me first check the database schema to confirm what data is available."
