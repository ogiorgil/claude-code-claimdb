Even if we could compute percentages of heroes with \"Bad\" alignment, that number tells us nothing about whether those characters are \"more compelling protagonists to readers.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim makes a subjective value judgment about which superheroes are 'more compelling protagonists to readers.'
