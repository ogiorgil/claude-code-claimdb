It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If X happened, then Y would result.\" The claim imagines a scenario where certain superheroes' hair color is changed and asks what would happen to their publisher affiliations.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If all 185 cm tall human superheroes suddenly had red hair\" \u2014 this is clearly a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. The database records what actually is, not what would happen under imagined changes.\n\nEven though the second part of the claim (that publisher affiliations would remain unchanged) is trivially true (changing hair color wouldn't affect publisher data in a relational database), the claim is structured as a counterfactual and should be classified accordingly per the rules.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
