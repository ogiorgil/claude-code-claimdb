A factual component: Hamilton has a 74% rate of not holding first place in post-race driver standings.\n2. A subjective component: This is \"a disappointing performance for a driver of Lewis Hamilton's caliber.\"\n\nThe word \"disappointing\" is a subjective value judgment. Even if we can verify the 74% figure, whether that rate constitutes a \"disappointing performance\" is an opinion that cannot be objectively verified from database data alone.\n\n**Step 2: Classification.**\n\nPer the rules on SUBJECTIVE claims: \"If a claim's core assertion is a subjective judgment (even if it also contains verifiable numbers), classify as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\" The core assertion here is that the rate is \"disappointing\" \u2014 this is a qualitative assessment/value judgment. The hint mapping subjective language to a numeric query does NOT make the subjective claim verifiable.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the 74% rate is 'a disappointing performance for a driver of Lewis Hamilton's caliber,' which is a subjective value judgment.
