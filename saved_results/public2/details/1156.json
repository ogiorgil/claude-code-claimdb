A subjective opinion (\"considers... to have the best customer service\")\n2. A value judgment (\"best customer service in the region\")\n\nThis is clearly a **subjective** claim \u2014 it's about what a client *thinks* or *believes* about customer service quality. Databases record transactional and factual data, not personal opinions about service quality.\n\nEven if the database contains information about client 734, account 611, and an East Bohemia branch, the core assertion is a subjective judgment that cannot be verified from data alone.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim expresses a subjective opinion \u2014 that a client 'considers' a branch to have 'the best customer service in the region.'
