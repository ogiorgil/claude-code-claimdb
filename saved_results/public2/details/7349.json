Whether promotional materials are \"eye-catching\" is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone.\n\nThe hint tries to map this to `MAX(spent) WHERE category = 'Advertisement'`, but even if we can verify which event had the highest advertisement spending, \"most eye-catching\" is a value judgment \u2014 spending the most on advertisements doesn't necessarily mean the materials were \"eye-catching.\" The core assertion of the claim is subjective.\n\nPer my instructions: *\"Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\"*\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that the Yearly Kickoff had the 'most eye-catching promotional materials,' which is a subjective value judgment.
