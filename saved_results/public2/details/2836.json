User 58 voted on 2010-07-19 (potentially verifiable from a database)\n2. The user \"discussed that action with a coworker during lunch\" (this is a real-world event that no database would record)\n\nThe second part of the claim \u2014 discussing something with a coworker during lunch \u2014 is an **out-of-schema** concept. No database tracks lunch conversations between coworkers. This is not something that can be verified or refuted from database records.\n\nSince the core assertion includes a fact that cannot be verified from the database, the appropriate classification is NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim asserts that user 58 'discussed that action with a coworker during lunch,' which is a real-world event that no database would record.
