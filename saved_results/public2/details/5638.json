It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If unlimited substitutions had been permitted...\" and makes a prediction about what \"would have\" happened to average goals.\n\nThe database records what actually happened in matches. It cannot tell us what would have happened under different rules (unlimited substitutions). This is a classic \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from historical data.\n\nPer the workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
