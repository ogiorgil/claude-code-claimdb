Identifying the circuit with the highest altitude (verifiable from data)\n2. Asserting it is \"generally regarded as offering the most scenic backdrop\" (subjective judgment)\n\nThe core assertion of this claim is a subjective value judgment \u2014 whether a circuit offers \"the most scenic backdrop\" is an opinion that cannot be verified from database records. The database can tell us which circuit has the highest altitude, but not whether it's considered scenic.\n\nEven though the hint maps \"highest altitude\" to `max(alt)`, the claim's central assertion is about scenic beauty, which is a qualitative/subjective assessment not stored in any database.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the highest-altitude circuit is 'generally regarded as offering the most scenic backdrop,' which is a subjective value judgment.
