It describes a \"what if\" scenario - what would have happened if conditions had been different (no safety car). The language \"If... had occurred... would have\" is textbook counterfactual phrasing.\n\nA database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical alternative conditions. Whether a safety car period affected the race outcome is speculative and cannot be determined from race results data alone.\n\nEven if the database contained safety car information (which I can quickly check), it would only tell us that a safety car period *did* or *did not* occur - it cannot tell us what the results *would have been* without it.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If... had occurred... would have' language.
