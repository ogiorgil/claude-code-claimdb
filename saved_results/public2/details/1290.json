It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"what if we replaced chlorine with bromine\" \u2014 and asks what the outcome would be. The database records actual molecules and their actual labels; it does not record what would happen if atoms were swapped.\n\nKey counterfactual indicators:\n- \"If... were hypothetically replaced\"\n- \"would be labeled\"\n\nPer the workflow rules: *\"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"*\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
