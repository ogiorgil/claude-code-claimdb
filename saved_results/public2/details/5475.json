A database can record goals, results, and statistics, but not whether neutral fans found matches entertaining.\n\nEven if there were some proxy metric (like total goals scored), the claim's core assertion is about subjective entertainment value as perceived by neutral supporters \u2014 something no database can verify.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim is about what neutral supporters 'generally considered' to be 'the most entertaining' matches.
