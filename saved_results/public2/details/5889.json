Even if I can verify the numeric value (76) against the database, whether that number constitutes an \"impressive achievement\" is a matter of opinion.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO claims. The database can tell us what ratings players have, but it cannot tell us whether a particular rating \"should be considered impressive.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim makes a subjective value judgment \u2014 that a rating of 76 'should be considered an impressive achievement.'
