It asserts that a high free meal rate is a \"strong indicator\" that a school community \"values equity more than most other schools.\" \n\n- Whether a school \"values equity\" is a subjective/qualitative assessment\n- Whether a data point is a \"strong indicator\" of a value judgment is itself subjective\n- Free meal eligibility rates reflect socioeconomic demographics, not necessarily a community's values about equity\n\nEven though the underlying data (free meal rates) could be queried from the database, the **core assertion** is about what the data *means* in terms of community values \u2014 which is a subjective interpretation that cannot be verified from data alone.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO: the claim expresses a value judgment (\"values equity more\") that cannot be objectively verified from numerical data, regardless of what the numbers show.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that a 100% free meal rate indicates a school community 'values equity more than most other schools.'
