It's describing what *would have happened* under a different set of conditions that didn't actually occur.\n\nKey counterfactual language:\n- \"**If** the bank **had charged**...\" \u2014 subjunctive/conditional mood\n- \"**would have been** lower than it actually was\" \u2014 comparing a hypothetical outcome to the actual outcome\n\nThis is a textbook counterfactual claim. The database records what actually happened \u2014 actual account balances, actual transactions. It does not and cannot record what would have happened if the bank had implemented a different fee structure.\n\nEven though we could theoretically compute a hypothetical balance by subtracting fees, the claim is asking us to verify a scenario that never occurred. The database only contains factual records of what happened, not simulations of alternative scenarios.\n\nPer the instructions: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
