It asks what *would have happened* under a hypothetical medical intervention (taking allopurinol). The database records actual observed data, not hypothetical outcomes of medications that were not taken. No SQL query can verify what a patient's uric acid level \"would have been\" under a different treatment regimen.\n\nPer the classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
