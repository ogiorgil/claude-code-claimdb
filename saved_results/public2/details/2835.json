It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If voting had been disabled on 2010-07-19, the user with Id 58 **would have** chosen to leave a comment instead.\"\n\nThis is speculating about what a user **would have done** under different circumstances. A database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened in an alternate reality. There is no way to verify from the data whether a user \"would have chosen\" to do something differently if a feature had been disabled.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim describing a hypothetical scenario ('If voting had been disabled... the user would have chosen to leave a comment instead').
