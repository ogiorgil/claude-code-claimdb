Even if I can identify the users and their statistics, whether their behavior constitutes \"notably strong commitment to community best practices\" is a qualitative assessment that cannot be objectively verified from data alone.\n\nWords like \"notably strong commitment\" and \"community best practices\" are subjective evaluations. The database can tell us numeric facts about users (views, reputation, posts, etc.), but it cannot tell us whether those numbers represent a \"strong commitment to community best practices.\"\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that certain users 'demonstrate a notably strong commitment to community best practices,' which is a subjective value judgment.
