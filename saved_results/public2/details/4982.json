Even if I can compute the DNF rate for Italian drivers from the database, whether that rate is \"unacceptable\" is a matter of opinion, not something that can be verified from data alone.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO. The word \"unacceptably\" is a value judgment similar to \"alarmingly,\" \"impressively,\" or other qualitative assessments listed in the guidelines. While the underlying statistic (DNF rate) might be computable, the core assertion \u2014 that this rate is \"unacceptable\" \u2014 cannot be objectively verified from a database.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that Italian F1 drivers' DNF rate is 'unacceptably high,' which is a subjective value judgment.
