It's asking what **would have happened** under a different selection methodology.\n\nThe claim describes:\n1. A hypothetical alternative rating system (\"ELO-style dynamic form metric\") that doesn't exist in the database\n2. A \"what if\" scenario about how player groupings would change under this hypothetical system\n3. Whether the oldest player in the group would be different under this imagined alternative\n\nThis is a textbook **counterfactual** claim. The database records what actually happened (actual ratings), not what would have happened under an alternative rating methodology. There's no \"ELO-style dynamic form metric\" in the database to compare against.\n\nPer the classification rules: *\"COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical 'what if' scenario. Look for language like 'If X had happened...', 'Had X been done...', 'If X were changed...', 'Would have...' These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\"*\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
