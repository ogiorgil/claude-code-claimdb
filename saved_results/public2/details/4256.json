It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If attribute values were normalized to a maximum of 90 instead of 100...\" This is asking about what *would* happen under a different system, not what actually exists in the database.\n\nThe database records actual attribute values as they are. It does not contain information about what would happen if the scoring system were changed to use a different maximum. A normalization to 90 instead of 100 would involve a transformation that isn't defined by the data itself \u2014 there are multiple ways to \"normalize to a maximum of 90,\" and the claim is speculating about a hypothetical outcome.\n\nPer the instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim begins with \"If attribute values were normalized to a maximum of 90 instead of 100\" \u2014 this is classic counterfactual language (\"If X were changed...\").\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
