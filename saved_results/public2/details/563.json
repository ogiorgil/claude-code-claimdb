It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If female salaries... were adjusted for cost-of-living differences...\" The database records actual data, not what would happen under hypothetical cost-of-living adjustments. The claim asks us to imagine a scenario that didn't happen and predict an outcome.\n\nAccording to my classification rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe phrase \"If female salaries in every district were adjusted for cost-of-living differences\" is clearly a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. The database would not contain cost-of-living adjustment factors, and even if it did, this is asking about what *would* happen under a hypothetical adjustment.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
