Even with this mapping, the core assertion remains subjective - whether having the most goals makes a league \"the most entertaining to watch\" is a value judgment.\n\nBut let me still consider: the hint is trying to operationalize \"entertaining\" as \"most goals.\" Let me check if this is a subjective claim per the instructions.\n\nPer the instructions:\n> SUBJECTIVE: The claim expresses opinions, value judgments, or qualitative assessments that cannot be objectively verified from data alone. Watch for words like: \"alarmingly\", \"impressively\", \"implausibly\", \"unremarkable\", \"eye-catching\", \"convenient\", \"nurturing\"...\n> Even if a hint maps subjective language to a numeric query, the claim is STILL subjective if its core assertion is a value judgment.\n\nThe phrase \"most entertaining to watch\" is clearly a subjective value judgment. Even though the hint maps it to a numeric query (most goals), the instructions explicitly state that hints mapping subjective language to numeric queries do NOT make a subjective claim verifiable.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim that a league season was 'the most entertaining to watch' is a subjective value judgment.
