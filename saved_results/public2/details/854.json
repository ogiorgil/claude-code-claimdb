Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If the bank had enforced...\" and \"would have gone negative\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under a hypothetical zero-balance floor policy.\n\nEven though we could potentially query the database to find accounts with monthly issuance (`POPLATEK MESICNE`) and credit card withdrawals (`VYBER KARTOU`) that went negative, the core assertion is about a hypothetical scenario that never occurred. We cannot truly verify from the data whether enforcing such a policy would have prevented negative balances, because:\n\n1. The database records actual transactions, not simulated ones under different rules.\n2. Customer behavior might have changed under different policies.\n3. The ordering and timing of transactions could affect outcomes in ways the database doesn't fully capture.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If the bank had enforced...' and 'would have gone negative.'
