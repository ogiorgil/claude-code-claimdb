The phrase \"more aesthetically pleasing to synthetic chemists\" is a value judgment \u2014 it expresses an opinion about the aesthetic appeal of chemical compounds. No database of toxicology data can verify whether something is \"aesthetically pleasing\" to chemists. This is a qualitative, subjective assessment.\n\nEven though the hint maps \"triple bond\" to `bond_type = '#'` (which could be queried), the **core assertion** of the claim is not about the presence or count of triple bonds \u2014 it's about whether they are \"aesthetically pleasing,\" which is a subjective judgment that cannot be verified from data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective value judgment \u2014 that compounds with triple bonds are 'more aesthetically pleasing to synthetic chemists.'
