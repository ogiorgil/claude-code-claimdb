  "reasoning": "The claim's core assertion is that brown hair is 'widely regarded by fans as the most iconic hair color,' which is a subjective value judgment about fan opinions and cultural perception. A database of superhero attributes records factual data (heights, hair colors, races) but cannot verify what fans regard as 'iconic.' Even if the data showed brown hair is the most common, that would not confirm it is the most 'iconic' in fans' eyes. This is a SUBJECTIVE claim that cannot be verified from the database.",
