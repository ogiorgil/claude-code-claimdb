It describes a hypothetical scenario:\n- \"If... had been repeated after withholding any anticoagulant medications for 48 hours\"\n- \"...would have been lower\"\n\nThe claim is asking what *would have happened* under different conditions (withholding anticoagulant medications and repeating tests). This is a \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened.\n\nKey counterfactual language:\n- \"If... had been repeated\" \u2014 hypothetical action\n- \"would have been lower\" \u2014 predicted outcome of the hypothetical\n\nEven though the database may contain information about APTT values and thrombosis status, it cannot tell us what results would have been obtained if tests were repeated under different medication conditions. The database records actual observations, not hypothetical alternative outcomes.\n\nAccording to my instructions: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
