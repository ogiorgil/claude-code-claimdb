How club members **felt** about parking expenses\n2. Whether they considered it a **worthwhile investment**\n3. Whether it was for **convenience**\n\nThese are subjective judgments and opinions \u2014 feelings, value assessments (\"worthwhile\"), and qualitative characterizations (\"convenience\"). A database can store factual records like expense amounts, descriptions, and dates, but it cannot capture whether members *felt* something was worthwhile or convenient.\n\nEven though the hint maps \"Parking\" to a specific query (`SUM(cost) WHERE expense_description = 'Parking'`), the core assertion of the claim is not about a numeric total \u2014 it's about members' **sentiments and opinions** regarding those expenses. No SQL query can verify whether people \"felt\" something was \"worthwhile.\"\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim is fundamentally subjective.
