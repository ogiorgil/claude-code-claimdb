It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If all patients had adhered to a low-purine diet for two weeks prior to testing...\" This is asking what *would have happened* under different conditions that didn't actually occur. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened if patients had changed their diets.\n\nKey indicators of counterfactual language:\n- \"If all patients had adhered...\" (past perfect subjunctive - hypothetical condition)\n- \"...would have been approximately equal\" (conditional result of hypothetical)\n\nThe database has no information about:\n- Whether patients followed any particular diet\n- What effect a low-purine diet would have on uric acid levels\n- What the results would look like under hypothetical dietary changes\n\nPer my workflow rules: **\"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\"**\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
