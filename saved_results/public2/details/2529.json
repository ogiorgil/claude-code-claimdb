This is a qualitative/aesthetic assessment about visual quality and user experience.\n\nEven though the hint maps this to a numeric query about the percentage of Japanese non-foil cards, the core assertion of the claim is about **reading experience quality** \u2014 whether something is \"clearer\" or \"more pleasant.\" These are subjective value judgments that cannot be objectively verified from database records about card attributes.\n\nThe database can tell us how many cards are non-foil-only vs. foil among Japanese-translated cards, but it cannot tell us anything about:\n- Whether the reading experience is \"clearer\"\n- Whether the reading experience is \"more pleasant\"\n- Comparative quality of reading experience between foil and non-foil versions\n\nThese are inherently subjective assessments about physical card properties and human perception that no structured database of card game metadata could verify.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is a subjective judgment about reading experience quality ('clearer, more pleasant reading experience').
