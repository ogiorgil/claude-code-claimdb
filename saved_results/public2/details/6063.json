The database records factual data, not opinions about whether ratings are deserved.\n\nThis falls squarely into the **SUBJECTIVE** category of NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim that players are 'generally overrated by fans compared to their real on-field impact' is a subjective value judgment.
