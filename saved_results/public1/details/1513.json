It asks about a hypothetical scenario: \"If the atom were replaced with fluorine...\" This describes something that did not actually happen \u2014 it's asking about what *would* happen under an imagined change.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
