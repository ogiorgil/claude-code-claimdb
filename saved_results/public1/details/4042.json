It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If characters from independent webcomics were included...\" This imagines adding data that doesn't exist in the database and then speculates about what the result would be.\n\nThe database records what is actually in the dataset, not what would happen if hypothetical additional data were added. There's no way to verify from the existing database what would happen if independent webcomic characters were included.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios should always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
