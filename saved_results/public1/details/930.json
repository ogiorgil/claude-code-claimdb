Let me explain why.\n\nThe claim states: **\"If, hypothetically, the partner bank 'AB' had introduced zero-fee interbank transfers in 1995, more accounts in North Bohemia would have conducted transactions with it.\"**\n\nThis is a **counterfactual** claim. It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If X had happened, then Y would have resulted.\" Key indicators:\n\n1. **\"If, hypothetically\"** \u2014 explicitly frames this as a hypothetical scenario.\n2. **\"had introduced zero-fee interbank transfers\"** \u2014 describes something that did not actually happen.\n3. **\"more accounts... would have conducted transactions\"** \u2014 speculates about what the outcome would have been under this imagined scenario.\n\nA database records **what actually happened**, not what **would have happened** under different conditions. There is no way to verify or refute a counterfactual claim from historical data alone \u2014 it would require causal modeling and assumptions beyond what the data can provide.\n\nPer the workflow rules, counterfactual claims must **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
