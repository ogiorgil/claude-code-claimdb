It uses the conditional \"If X had happened...\" construction, asking about a hypothetical scenario where North Bohemia was reorganized differently. The claim then asserts that under this imaginary reorganization, certain counts would remain the same.\n\nA database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical administrative reorganizations. This is a textbook counterfactual \u2014 it describes an imagined scenario and asks about its consequences.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
