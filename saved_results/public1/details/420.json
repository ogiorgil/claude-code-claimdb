It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If California had increased per-pupil funding by 10%...\" and then makes a prediction about what would have happened under that hypothetical condition.\n\nThe database records what actually happened \u2014 it cannot tell us what *would have* happened under different funding policies. No SQL query can verify or refute a counterfactual \"what if\" scenario.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as **NOT ENOUGH INFO**.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If California had increased per-pupil funding by 10% in 2002...would have opened...').
