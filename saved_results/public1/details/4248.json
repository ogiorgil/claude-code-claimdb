It describes a \"what if\" scenario: \"If alternate-reality versions of characters were merged with their primary counterparts before computing the mean...\" This imagines a hypothetical data transformation that didn't actually happen.\n\nThe claim uses \"If X were done... the result would be Y\" language, which is a classic counterfactual pattern.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis claim clearly falls into the counterfactual category. It asks what would happen \"if\" alternate-reality versions were merged \u2014 a hypothetical transformation of data. The database records what actually exists, not what would result from imagined merging operations.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
