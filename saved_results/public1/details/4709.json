It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If rain had started on lap 30...\" and then speculates about what \"would have\" happened. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical weather conditions.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because databases only record what actually happened, not what would have happened under imagined circumstances.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
