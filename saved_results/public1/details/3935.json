It describes a \"what if\" scenario: \"If all 185 cm tall human superheroes suddenly had red hair...\" This is imagining a change that hasn't actually happened and asking about what would result.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThe claim uses \"If... suddenly had...\" which is classic counterfactual language. Even though one might argue that changing hair color wouldn't affect publisher affiliations (since they're independent fields), the instructions are explicit: counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If... suddenly had...' language, describing a hypothetical scenario where 185 cm tall human superheroes' hair color is changed to red.
