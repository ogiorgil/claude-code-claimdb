  "reasoning": "Rangers recorded 11 away wins in the 2009/2010 Scotland Premier League season, which is the maximum number of away wins by any team that season (tied with Celtic at 11). Per the hint's interpretation where 'won the most' refers to MAX(COUNT(*)), Rangers achieved the maximum count of away wins, supporting the claim.",
