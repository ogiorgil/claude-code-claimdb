It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If X had happened... Y would have happened.\" The claim asks what *would have* occurred if mana costs were changed \u2014 this is an imagined scenario that cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened.\n\nThe database records actual card data, not what would happen under hypothetical modifications to card attributes. There's no way to determine from the database whether reducing mana costs would cause cards to see more play in Limited formats.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim ('If every Coldsnap card... had its mana cost reduced by one... would have doubled').
