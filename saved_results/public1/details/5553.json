It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If European youth academies **had mandated** equal-foot training...\" and then speculates about what **would** have happened. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical training mandates.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim uses \"If... had mandated...\" and \"would report...\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database cannot tell us what would have happened under a different training regime.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
