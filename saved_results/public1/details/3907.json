It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If artists standardized character designs...\" \u2014 and speculates about what *would* happen to average weights under that imagined condition. The database only records the actual data about superheroes as they exist, not what would happen if their designs were changed to reflect realistic human physiology.\n\nEven though we could query the current average weight of female superheroes, we cannot verify from the database what the weights *would be* if designs were changed to reflect \"realistic human physiology.\" That requires external knowledge about realistic BMI/height-weight relationships that isn't in the database.\n\nThis is clearly a **counterfactual** claim and should be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
