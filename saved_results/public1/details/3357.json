It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the platform's 2011 interface **had** labeled 50-point bounties as 'premium'...\" and then speculates about what **would have** happened (\"more posts would have had...\").\n\nThe claim is asking about what would have occurred under a different, imagined interface design \u2014 something that never actually happened. A database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical UI changes.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
