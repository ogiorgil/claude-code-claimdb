Let me analyze it:\n\nThe claim says \"**If** Drag Reduction System **had been available**...\" and \"his maximum speed **would have been** higher.\" This is a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario describing what would have happened under different conditions (i.e., if DRS technology had been available during a past race).\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical scenarios using language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Would have...\", etc., **cannot be verified** from a database that only records what actually happened. These must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThere's no need to query the database, as regardless of what data exists about Vitantonio Liuzzi's fastest lap speed, the database records actual historical facts \u2014 not what would have happened under hypothetical technological changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
