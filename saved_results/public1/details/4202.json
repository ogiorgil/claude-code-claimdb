It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If comic publishers had mandated gender parity...\" This is asking about what *would have happened* under an imaginary policy change, not what actually happened.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim uses \"If comic publishers had mandated...\" and \"would be exactly 1:1\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under a hypothetical gender parity mandate.\n\nEven though one could theoretically try to compute something, the rules are explicit: **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO.**\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim using 'If...had mandated...would be' language, describing a hypothetical scenario where publishers enforced gender parity.
