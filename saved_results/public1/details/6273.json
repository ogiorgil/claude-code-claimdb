It uses the structure \"If [patient] had presented without [X], [Y] would have happened.\" It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 what would have occurred if circumstances had been different from what actually happened.\n\nA database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes. There is no way to verify from the data whether a diagnosis \"would have been postponed by six months\" in an alternate scenario.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
