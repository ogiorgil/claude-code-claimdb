It describes a hypothetical scenario (\"if the safety car had been deployed\") and speculates about what **would have happened** under that scenario. Key indicators:\n\n- \"If... had been deployed\" \u2014 hypothetical condition\n- \"would have been\" \u2014 speculative consequence\n- The claim imagines an alternate reality where a safety car was deployed and asks about its effect on lap speeds\n\nA database only records **what actually happened**, not what would have happened under different conditions. There is no way to verify or refute this counterfactual from the data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
