It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank **had charged** a monthly maintenance fee...\" This is asking about what **would have happened** under a different set of conditions than what actually occurred.\n\nThe claim uses classic counterfactual language:\n- \"If the bank had charged...\" (hypothetical condition)\n- \"...would have been lower than it actually was\" (hypothetical consequence)\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nThis is clearly a counterfactual claim. The database records actual transactions and balances, not what balances would have been if the bank had charged hypothetical fees. Even though one might be tempted to compute the answer (subtracting monthly fees from the balance), the instructions are explicit: counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
