It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If attribute values were normalized to a maximum of 90 instead of 100...\" This is asking about what **would happen** under a different system, not what actually exists in the database.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\n> COUNTERFACTUAL: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"If attribute values were normalized to a maximum of 90 instead of 100\" \u2014 this is clearly a hypothetical change to how the data would be structured. The database records actual attribute values, not what would happen under a different normalization scheme. We cannot determine from the database alone how a renormalization would redistribute values or which heroes would end up at the new maximum.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
