Even though the hint maps this to a numeric query (MAX(spent) where category = 'Advertisement'), the claim's core assertion is about materials being \"eye-catching\" \u2014 which is a qualitative/aesthetic judgment that cannot be objectively verified from spending data alone.\n\nSpending the most on advertisements does not necessarily mean the materials were \"the most eye-catching.\" That's a value judgment about visual appeal and effectiveness.\n\nPer the instructions:\n> If a claim's core assertion is a subjective judgment (even if it also contains verifiable numbers), classify as NOT ENOUGH INFO. Hints that map subjective language to numeric queries do NOT make a subjective claim verifiable.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim's core assertion is that the Yearly Kickoff had the 'most eye-catching promotional materials,' which is a subjective/qualitative judgment about visual appeal.
