It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If unlimited substitutions had been permitted\" \u2014 and makes a prediction about what would have happened under that scenario (\"average goals scored by home teams would have been lower\").\n\nThe database records what actually happened in matches. It cannot tell us what would have happened under a different set of rules (unlimited substitutions). No amount of querying can verify or refute a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
