It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If X had happened...\" \u2014 specifically, \"If all supplemental sets released since 2018 were localized into Chinese Simplified.\" The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under imagined conditions.\n\nLet me verify this is indeed counterfactual by confirming the language used: \"**If** all supplemental sets released since 2018 **were** localized...\" \u2014 this is clearly subjunctive/hypothetical language.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
