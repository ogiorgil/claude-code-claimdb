The claim uses counterfactual language (\"If... had... would have...\").\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios **cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened**. These must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nEven though the hint suggests there might be relevant cholesterol data in the database, the claim is not asking whether cholesterol increased or decreased \u2014 it's asserting what **would have happened** under a hypothetical dietary change. No database can verify counterfactual hypotheticals.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
