It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If DRS had malfunctioned...\" and speculates about what \"would have\" happened. The claim uses classic counterfactual language (\"If X had happened... Y would have been...\").\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. The database records actual lap times and race data, not what would have happened under different mechanical conditions.\n\nThere is no need to query the database for this claim, but let me briefly confirm the database doesn't have any DRS malfunction simulation data:"
