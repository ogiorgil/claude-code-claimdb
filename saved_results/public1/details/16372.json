It describes a hypothetical scenario \u2014 \"If a nationwide 10% fuel subsidy had been in effect...\" \u2014 and speculates about what would have happened under that imagined condition. The database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under a hypothetical fuel subsidy policy.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims should always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, regardless of the data in the database. There's no need to query the database to verify a hypothetical scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
