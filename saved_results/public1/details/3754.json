It asks what **would happen if** the definition of 'Agility' were changed. Key indicators:\n\n- \"If the 'Agility' superpower **were redefined**...\"\n- \"the number... **would increase**...\"\n\nThis describes a hypothetical scenario about redefining a superpower category. The database records what actually is, not what would happen under hypothetical redefinitions. There is no data in any database about \"parkour proficiency without superhuman enhancement\" or how many heroes would qualify under a redefined power.\n\nEven though I can verify the current state of blue-eyed superheroes with Agility, I cannot verify what would happen under a hypothetical redefinition. The database has no information about parkour proficiency or alternative definitions of superpowers.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
