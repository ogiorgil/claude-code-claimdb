It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the bank had eliminated monthly account maintenance fees...\" and then speculates about what \"would have\" happened. The language \"If... had... would have...\" is classic counterfactual construction.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. They should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nLet me briefly verify the database schema to confirm this assessment, but the classification is clear from the claim's structure."
