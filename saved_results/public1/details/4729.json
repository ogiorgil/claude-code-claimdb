It asks about a hypothetical scenario: \"If no safety car period had occurred...\" and then makes an assertion about what \"would have\" happened. This describes an imagined alternative scenario, not something that actually occurred.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because a database only records what actually happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\nLet me briefly verify that the database doesn't contain safety car data, just to be thorough:"
