It describes a scenario where \"Los Angeles County adopted universal free school meals next year\" \u2014 something that hasn't happened \u2014 and then makes a prediction about what would happen to eligibility percentages.\n\nThe key language is:\n- \"**If** Los Angeles County adopted...\" \u2014 hypothetical condition\n- \"**next year**\" \u2014 future event\n- \"**would not exceed**\" \u2014 prediction about a hypothetical outcome\n\nThis is a classic counterfactual: it asks about what would happen under a hypothetical policy change (universal free school meals). The database only records what actually happened, not what would happen if a new policy were adopted. We cannot verify from the database what effect \"universal free school meals\" would have on eligibility percentages.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
