It asks what **would have happened** if DRS had been banned \u2014 a hypothetical scenario that never occurred. The database only records what actually happened in Formula 1, not what would have happened under different technical regulations.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThe claim begins with \"If Drag Reduction System (DRS) had been banned...\" \u2014 this is classic counterfactual language. The database cannot tell us what lap times would have been without DRS, as it only records actual lap times that occurred with the rules as they were.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
