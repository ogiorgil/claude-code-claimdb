The claim asks what *would have happened* under an imagined condition, not what actually happened.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. These should always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
