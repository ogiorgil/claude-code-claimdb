It describes a \"what if\" scenario \u2014 what would happen if a superhero were placed in a hypothetical world without gravity. The database records factual information about superheroes, not predictions about how they would perform under hypothetical physical conditions.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe hypothetical \"what if\" scenarios should ALWAYS be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, because databases only record what actually exists/happened, not what would happen under imagined scenarios.\n\nThere's no need to query the database for this classification, but let me verify that Helen Parr exists in the database for completeness."
