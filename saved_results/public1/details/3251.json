It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If [the platform] had hidden comment scores...\" and then makes an assertion about what \"would\" have happened. This is speculating about user behavior under conditions that did not actually occur.\n\nThe database can only record what actually happened \u2014 it cannot tell us what would have happened if scores had been hidden from users. No SQL query can verify whether hiding scores would or would not have changed a user's behavior.\n\nAccording to my classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as **NOT ENOUGH INFO**.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
