It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If the SAT had introduced a mandatory science section...\" This never actually happened. The claim asks what *would have* occurred under an imagined change to the SAT format.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules, counterfactual claims that describe \"what if\" scenarios cannot be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. The correct classification is always **NOT ENOUGH INFO**.\n\nNo database query can determine what would have happened to test-taker numbers if the SAT had added a science section \u2014 that's a hypothetical scenario, not a factual one recorded in any database.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
