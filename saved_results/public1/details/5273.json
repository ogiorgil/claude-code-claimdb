It says \"If a late-race safety car had been deployed...\" \u2014 this describes a hypothetical scenario that didn't actually happen. The claim is speculating about what *would have* happened under different circumstances.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nThis claim uses \"If a late-race safety car had been deployed\" \u2014 classic counterfactual language. The database records what actually happened in races, not what would have happened if a safety car had been deployed. There's no way to verify or refute this hypothetical from the data.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
