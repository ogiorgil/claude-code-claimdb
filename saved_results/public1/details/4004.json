The database records what actually exists, not what would exist under hypothetical modifications to the dataset.\n\nPer the classification rules, counterfactual claims must always be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, regardless of whether the underlying data could theoretically be queried.\n\nHowever, let me re-read the claim more carefully. It says \"If all non-human races were removed from the dataset, the ratio of total superheroes to those with no skin colour would be lower.\" This is actually comparing a hypothetical filtered dataset to the current dataset. Let me think about whether this is truly counterfactual or if it's a computable comparison.\n\nActually, this could be interpreted as: \"Among human-race superheroes only, the ratio of total to those with no skin colour is lower than the same ratio for all superheroes.\" This is a comparison we can compute from the data. Let me verify.\n\nWait \u2014 but the claim uses counterfactual language (\"If... were removed... would be\"). Even though the numbers are computable, the framing is counterfactual. Let me check the guidelines again...\n\nThe guidelines say: \"NEVER try to 'compute' an answer for a counterfactual claim. The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO.\"\n\nThis is clearly counterfactual language. The claim says \"If X were done, Y would happen\" \u2014 a hypothetical scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"The claim uses counterfactual language ('If all non-human races were removed... the ratio... would be lower'), describing a hypothetical scenario of modifying the dataset.
