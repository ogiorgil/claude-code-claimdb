It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If patients older than 60 years **had been made** ineligible...\" and then speculates about what \"**would have**\" happened. This uses classic counterfactual language (\"If X had been done... Y would have...\").\n\nThe database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different eligibility rules. This is a \"what if\" scenario that cannot be verified from historical data.\n\nAccording to my workflow rules:\n\n> **COUNTERFACTUAL**: The claim describes a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario. Look for language like \"If X had happened...\", \"Had X been done...\", \"If X were changed...\", \"Would have...\", etc. These imagined scenarios CANNOT be verified from a database that only records what actually happened. ALWAYS classify counterfactual claims as NOT ENOUGH INFO.\n\nAnd:\n\n> **NEVER try to \"compute\" an answer for a counterfactual claim.** The correct label is always NOT ENOUGH INFO, because the database records what happened, not what would have happened under hypothetical changes.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
