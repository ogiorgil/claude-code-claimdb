It describes a hypothetical scenario: \"If heavy rain had fallen...\" and speculates about what \"would have\" happened. The database records what actually happened, not what would have happened under different weather conditions.\n\nAccording to my instructions, counterfactual claims should **always** be classified as NOT ENOUGH INFO, regardless of what data exists in the database. I should not attempt to compute or verify hypothetical scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"reasoning\": \"This is a counterfactual claim.
